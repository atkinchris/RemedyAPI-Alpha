RemedyAPI
A friendly wrapper for BMC's Remedy API for .Net.
=========

Author and Copyright: Chris Atkin, 2014


This class library acts as a logical wrapper around BMC's .Net API for Remedy ITSM, exposing easy to use, checked methods to query incidents in .Net.

The underlying Remedy API is owned entirely by BMC, and is not included in this project. Please see https://communities.bmc.com/docs/DOC-50 for more details, and to download the API itself.
